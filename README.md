# ✷✷✷ ZBROJKO ✷✷✷

_A simple mobile game for children to get them familiar with the concept of numbers, adding and subtracting._

### Concept
I got the idea from browsing a certain online shopping site where I stumbled upon this:

I found the concept interesting and educational, but the toy itself was small, plastic and cheap-looking. So I decided to digitise it :) <br>

### Design
There will be a cute animal(ish) 3D character - Zbrojko - in the centre of the screen who will hold the scales. The character will have simple animations. <br>
On the top of the screen, there will be a UI panel with colorful numbers, and on the bottom of the screen a UI panel with miniature versions of the 3D character (so called Zbrojkići). <br>

The numbers, when dragged into the container, spawn a happy-looking 3D number which does simple animations and dances.

<br>*I can't draw well, but this is the gist of it :)*

Zbrojkići, when dragged into the container, do the same. 

### Mechanics
The game will only require dragging numbers from the top of the screen to the number container and Zbrojkići from the bottom of the screen to the corresponding container until the scales balance out. <br>
Each Zbrojkić has a value of 1. <br>
There can be one or two numbers in the number container (addition). <br>
Numbers and Zbrojkići can be disposed of into a basket which appears on the corresponding side of the screen when they are dragged there (subtraction).
The scales will tip in favour of the larger number until they balance out.

### Release
No release date as of yet.
